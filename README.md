A simple dyndns client made for Termux, Linux (change bash/sh path). You can make use of
available regex patterns to find your address more faster.
Since interface change device by device, you have to try 3 patterns in the code and use 
the working one. By default, 3rd pattern works perfectly most times.
Again, if you prefer online lookup, its done by default.
Give execute permission if needed; `chmod +x termux-dyn-client`

USAGE;

`-t YOUR-TOKEN YOUR-HOSTNAME.ROOT `
